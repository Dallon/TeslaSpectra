Tesla Spectra mainly runs on Python!:D

The website is built with Django and the programs that populate the website are built with Python using Selenium as the webscraper. Originally intended as a blog about tesla news the website now is in building stages hopefully to become a hub of news information about Tesla from all over the web such as reddit, twitter, the US Patent Office, tesla news outlets and various tesla websites.
