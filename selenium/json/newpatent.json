{"patent": "Connected Vehicle Network Access Optimization Using an Intermediary Platform", "filing date": "March 17, 2022", "abstract": "Concepts and technologies directed to connected vehicle network access optimization are disclosed herein. Embodiments can include a system that includes a processor and a memory storing computer-executable instructions that configure a processor to perform operations. The operations can include receiving an access probe message from a telematics control unit of a vehicle. The operations can include determining that the telematics control unit is not authorized to access a network communication service. The operations can further include generating an access redirect command that instructs a head unit of the vehicle to bypass a machine-to-machine platform so as to enable access to the network communication service via a network service portal. The operations can include providing the access redirect command to the telematics control unit of the vehicle.", "scraped_at": "2022-03-17 07:33:38.721917"}
