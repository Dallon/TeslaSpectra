{"patent": "MULTI-CHANNEL SENSOR SIMULATION FOR AUTONOMOUS CONTROL SYSTEMS", "filing date": "February 10, 2022", "abstract": "An autonomous control system combines sensor data from multiple sensors to simulate sensor data from high-capacity sensors. The sensor data contains information related to physical environments surrounding vehicles for autonomous guidance. For example, the sensor data may be in the form of images that visually capture scenes of the surrounding environment, geo-location of the vehicles, and the like. The autonomous control system simulates high-capacity sensor data of the physical environment from replacement sensors that may each have lower capacity than high-capacity sensors. The high-capacity sensor data may be simulated via one or more neural network models. The autonomous control system performs various detection and control algorithms on the simulated sensor data to guide the vehicle autonomously.", "scraped_at": "2022-02-12 10:19:58.836378"}
